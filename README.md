with the tomato juice can

##### This program runs at clicking the start bottom. It will print various copies of the same image on the background of the page following Andy Warhol's tomato juice can art piece. The brand chosen was "Garoto" a Brazilian chocolate manufacturer, biggest brand in the country located in Vila Velha, Espirito Santo, my home state, founded by a German immigrant, Heinrich Mayerfreund in 1929. Sold worldwide under surnames, such as Regal Dynasty sold at Walgreens Pharmacies, and under the main brand, Garoto at latinx supermarkets.
##### The company was acquired by Nestle in 2002 for a total of 250 Millions dollars in a ugly battle between the Brazilian Government which did not wanted the chocolate monopoly to be sold for a worldwide competitor, and the Mayerfreund family which maintained their position that the decision of selling or not was theirs only as the owners of the manufacturer. It resulted in an agreement between Nestle and the family, in which the brand Nestle, after the purchase, became the main owner of the  manufacturer  but the brand is still managed by the Mayerfreund family and separately operating on the same site.
